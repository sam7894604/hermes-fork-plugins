"""turbovault-fixups — keep turbovault (Obsidian vault over MCP) edits from tripping core safety nets.

Two ``pre_tool_call`` rules plus one ``post_tool_call`` observer, all fail-open:

1. **Repair malformed ``edit_note`` payloads.** Weak models often emit ``SEARCH:``/``REPLACE:``
   labels or ``old_string``/``new_string`` JSON instead of aider SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, which the
   tool rejects ("No SEARCH/REPLACE blocks found in input") and the agent then falls back to a
   full-note overwrite. The hook rewrites the known malformed shapes before dispatch
   (``{"action": "modify"}``); anything unrecognized passes through untouched so turbovault stays
   the final authority on what is valid.
2. **Skip the spurious local ``patch`` after a vault write landed.** After ``write_note`` /
   ``edit_note`` succeeds the model sometimes also issues a local ``patch`` on the raw vault path
   (``/root/生活/旅遊/x.md``), which cannot exist locally. That patch fails, and core's
   file-mutation verifier then appends a "files were NOT modified" footer to a reply whose content
   DID land — in the vault. Blocking the doomed patch (only when the path does not exist locally and
   a vault write succeeded in this session recently) keeps the verifier honest without touching
   core: nothing failed, so there is nothing to warn about.

MCP tools reach the same hooks as built-ins under their registry name (``mcp__<server>__<tool>``);
``{"action": "modify"}`` and ``{"action": "block"}`` are the documented directives
(website/docs/user-guide/features/hooks.md).
