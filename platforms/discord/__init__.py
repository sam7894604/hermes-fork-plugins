"""Discord platform override — entry point with a stock-adapter fallback.

The override subclasses the bundled adapter, so an upstream change to an internal seam can make
``adapter.py`` fail to import or its registration raise. Shadowing a bundled platform leaves no
automatic fallback, so this module provides it: on failure the bundled Discord adapter is
registered instead and the error is logged. The platform then runs WITHOUT the auto-choice
buttons and the LINE whitelist decision card.
